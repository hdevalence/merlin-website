# Future Work

Merlin is feature-complete and the transcript functions are stable.  It
provides a single parameterization (using Keccak) aimed at software
implementations.  However, in the future, it would be interesting to
provide a second parameterization (or family of parameterizations) aimed
at use within a circuit, using a circuit-friendly sponge construction
instead of Keccak.
