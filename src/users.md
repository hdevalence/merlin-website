* [dalek-cryptography Bulletproofs][dalek_bp], a Ristretto-based
  Bulletproofs construction providing both range proofs and
  programmable constraint system proofs.  Merlin transcripts allow
  constructing adaptive constraint systems with [more efficient
  gadgets][shuffle_gadget].

* [dalek-cryptography zkp][zkp], a Ristretto-based toolkit for Schnorr proofs.
