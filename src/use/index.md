# Using Merlin

The preceding chapter, [Merlin Transcripts](../transcript/index.md),
describes how Merlin transcripts operate.

This chapter describes how
to use Merlin to implement a proof protocol:

- [Passing Transcripts](./passing.md) describes how to pass transcripts into proving and verification functions;
- [Transcript Protocols](./protocol.md) describes how to specify how a proof system's mathematical objects are encoded into transcript messages;
- [Sequential Composition](./composition.md) describes how sharing transcripts can provide sequential composition;
- [Prover-Verifier Duality](./duality.md) describes how two counterparties can interactively compose non-interactive proofs.
